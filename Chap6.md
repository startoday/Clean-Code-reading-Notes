### 对象和数据结构 (Objects and Data Structures)

1. Data Abstraction
    - We do not want to expose the details of our data. Rather we want to express our data in abstract terms. This is not merely accomplished by using interfaces         and/or getters and setters. Serious thought needs to be put into the best way to represent the data that an object contains
 
2. Data/Object Anti-Symmetry
    - Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the           classes must change. When it is hard to OO, then it is easy to procedural, oppsite is the same~

3. Data Transfer Objects(DTO)
