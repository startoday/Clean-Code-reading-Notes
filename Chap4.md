### 注释 

“Nothing can be quite so helpful as a well-placed comment. Nothing can clutter up a module more than frivolous dogmatic comments. Nothing can be quite so damaging as an old crufty comment that propagates lies and misinformation.”


* The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code 注释的恰当用法是要弥补代码表达意图的失败

如果发现自己需要写注释，那么想想能否避免！（ 哈哈哈 赞同！shout to Nav！）
  
  - 代码常常变动，注释却不一定总能得到维护
