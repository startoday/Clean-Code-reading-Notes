### 有意义的名字

1. Use Intention-Revealing Names
   - If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent
   - change your name when you find better ones
   - choose a name that specifies what is being measured and the unit of that measurement
     for example, choose "elapsedTimeInDays" instead of "ed"
   
2. Avoid Disinformation
   - avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning 词请答意
   - Beware of using names which vary in small ways. 别把名字命的太像，不好区分到时候
   - Awful！！！ Do not use l/o as name 太像 1 和 0 了有木有！
 
3. Make Meaningful Distinctions
   - Number-series naming (a1, a2, .. aN) are noninformative
   - Noise words are meaningless distinction. Eg: I have Product/ProductInfo/ ProductData, what are differences between them??
   - Noise words are redundant: Eg variable is no need to in a name...since it is!
   
4. Use Pronounceable Names
   -  make your names pronounceable 到时候讲代码的时候读不出来，多尴尬！！
  
5. Use Searchable Names
   -  Single-letter names and numeric constants are not easy to locate across a body of text！
 
6. Method Name should be Verb
   - Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment, deletePage, or save. Accessors, mutators, get, set, and is according to the javabean standard

7. pick one（and only one） word per concept *一以贯之*
   - Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get altogether
   
8. Don't PUN *一个名字唯一一个意思*
   - Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Use the propriate meaning of that word

9. 别添加没用的语境
   - 只要短名称足够清楚，就比长名称好
